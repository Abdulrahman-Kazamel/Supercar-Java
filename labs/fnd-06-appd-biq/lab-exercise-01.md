You can optimize the total cost of ownership by leveraging existing personnel, processes, and training on AppDynamics platform for traditional, cloud, or hybrid deployments.


## Objectives

In this Learning Lab you learn about AppDynamics Business IQ.

When you have completed this lab, you will be able to:

* Enable Analytics with the new Agentless Analytics Java Agent (v 4.5.15 +).
* Configure HTTP Data Collectors
* Configure Method Invocation Data Collectors
* Understand Dashboard Components
* Build a Business Dashboard.


## Prerequisites

This Lab has dependencies associated with the [Java Application Monitoring Fundamentals Lab](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/lab/fnd-01-appd-apm-java/step/1), including:

- Access to the AppDynamics sandbox.
- Access to the same two virtual machines you used in the [Java Application Monitoring Fundamentals Lab](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/lab/fnd-01-appd-apm-java/step/1).

Please complete the Java Application Monitoring Fundamentals Lab before you proceed with this Lab if you have not already done so.


## Lab Virtual Machines

The lab environment has two virtual machines:

* The first virtual machine hosts the AppDynamics Controller and will be referred to from this point on as the **Controller VM**.

* The second virtual machine hosts the Supercar Trader application used in the labs. It will be the host where you will install the AppDynamics agents and will be referred to from this point on as the **Application VM**.

> *Note*: These are the same two virtual machines you used in the [Java Application Monitoring Fundamentals Lab](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/lab/fnd-01-appd-apm-java/step/1).
