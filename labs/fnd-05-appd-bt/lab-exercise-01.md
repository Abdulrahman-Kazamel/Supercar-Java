![Lab Icon](assets/images/lab-icon.png) Database Visibility Monitoring Fundamentals
=========================================================================

In this Learning Lab, you learn about AppDynamics Database Visibility Monitoring. This lab has six components:

* Check the lab prerequisites
* Download the AppDynamics Database Visibility Agent
* Install the AppDynamics Database Visibility Agent
* Configure a Database Collector in the Controller
* Monitor and troubleshoot Database issues - Part 1
* Monitor and troubleshoot Database issues - Part 2

## Objective

When you have completed this Learning Lab, you will be able to:

* Install and configure the Database Visibility agent to monitor the health of your databases
* Troubleshoot database performance issues.

## Prerequisites

* You should already have access to the virtual machines for the lab. If you do not already have access to the VMs for the lab, follow the instructions [here](lab-exercise-00.md).
* You will need to use the same two virtual machines you used in the [Java Application Monitoring Fundamentals Lab](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/lab/fnd-01-appd-apm-java/step/1).
* This Lab has dependencies associated with the Java Application Monitoring Fundamentals Lab. Please complete the Java Application Monitoring Fundamentals Lab before you proceed with this Lab if you have not already done so.

## Lab Virtual Machines

The lab environment has two virtual machines:

* The first virtual machine hosts the AppDynamics Controller and will be referred to from this point on as the **Controller VM**.
* The second virtual machine hosts the Supercar Trader application used in the labs. It will be the host where you will install the AppDynamics agents and will be referred to from this point on as the **Application VM**.

**NOTE:** These will be the same two virtual machines you used in the [Java Application Monitoring Fundamentals Lab](../fnd-01-appd-apm-java/lab-exercise-01.md).
